# Cell Classification AI Model  

This repository contains the AI model I developed for **ProCom**, a competition focused on detecting and classifying normal and abnormal cells using advanced machine learning techniques.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The model leverages deep learning algorithms to analyze cell images and classify them as normal or abnormal. This approach aims to automate diagnostic tasks and assist medical professionals with early detection and treatment planning.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- **`cell_classification.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook containing all steps, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.  
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project (you’re here!).

---

## 🛠 Features  
- **Cell Classification**: Accurately distinguishes between normal and abnormal cells.  
- **End-to-End Workflow**: From preprocessing to model evaluation, all steps are included in the notebook.  
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Built using TensorFlow/Keras for robust performance.
